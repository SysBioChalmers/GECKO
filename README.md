## About GECKO 3.0

The **GECKO** toolbox enhances a **G**enome-scale model to account for **E**nzyme **C**onstraints, using **K**inetics and **O**mics. The resulting enzyme-constrained model (**ecModel**) can be used to perform simulations where enzyme allocation is either drawn from a total protein pool, or constrained by measured protein levels from proteomics data.

💡 In the [`GECKO/tutorials`](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/tree/main/tutorials) folder there are examples of how GECKO can be applied to GEMs, in either of its _full_ or _light_ forms. Each `protocol.m` contains instructions on how to reconstruct and analyze an ecModel, demonstrating how different fuctions in GECKO can be used. These two scripts complement the [protocols paper](#citation).

_**Note:** Regarding code and model compatibility with earlier GECKO versions, see [Previous versions: GECKO 1 and 2](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/wiki/Previous-versions:-GECKO-1-and-2)_.
