% findLimitingUBs
%   Find the top growth-limiting enzyme or enzyme complex in a given ecModel
%   overconstrained with proteomics data.
%   
%   model       ecModel with proteomic constraints (individual enzyme
%               levels)
%   protIndxs   Indexes of the protein exchange reactions (measured
%               enzymes)
%   flexFactor  Flexibilization factor used to relax the upper bounds in
%               every iteration
%   option      1 if the sensitivity analysis is done on the individual
%               enzyme exchanges or 2, if it is done on a reaction basis, 
%               for cases in which the limitation might be an enzyme
%               complex rather than an individual enzyme.
%
%   maxIndex    Index of the corresponding limiting enzyme exchange
%               reaction, this variable has a length>1 for cases in which 
%               the limitation was found to be a complex, every index 
%               correspond to the exchange reaction for every subunit in 
%               the complex.
%   flag        TRUE if a limiting enzyme or complex was found
%
%   Usage: [maxIndex,flag] = findLimitingUBs(model,protIndxs,flexFactor,option)
