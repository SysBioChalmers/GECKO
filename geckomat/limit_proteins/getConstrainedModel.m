%function [ecModel_batch,OptSigma] = getConstrainedModel(ecModel,sigma,Ptot,obj_Val,name)
%
% Function that gets a GEM with kinetic data and returns an enzyme 
% constrained model, either with individual enzyme levels or with the total
% measured protein content.
% 
% The model parameters are automatically curated (querying the BRENDA
% files) for reaching the experimental maximal growth rate on glucose
% minimal media (if it was overconstrained). Then, the average saturation 
% factor for enzymes is fitted for the same growth conditions. Finally the 
% fitted model is simulated on the same conditions and the top ten used 
% enzymes (mass-wise) are saved in a file as an output, this can be used for 
% suggesting further parameters curation (enzyme usages > 10% of the total 
% proteome).
