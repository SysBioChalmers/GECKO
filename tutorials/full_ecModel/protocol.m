% This file accompanies the GECKO 3 Nature Protocols paper https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-023-00931-7.
%
% The function of this script is to demonstrate the reconstruction and
% analysis of a *full* ecModel. As example, it here uses the yeast-GEM
% model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as starting point. However, this script
% does not claim to construct a "production-ready" ecYeastGEM model:
% dependent on how you intend to use the ecModel it may require additional
% curation and evaluation.
%
% DO NOT DIRECTLY USE THE ECMODEL GENERATED HERE OUTSIDE OF THIS TUTORIAL.
%
% In comparison to the published GECKO3 Nature Protocols paper, this script
% might have more up-to-date descriptions about the capabilities and
% functions, which were introduced after the Nature Protocols paper was
% published. This script will have additional commands and analyses that
% are not included in the paper as such. This script should always work with
% the most recent GECKO3 release. The STAGE and STEP numbers match those in the
% Nature Protocols paper.

%% Installation
% - Install RAVEN & GECKO
%   - Install RAVEN by following the installation instructions:
%     https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/RAVEN/wiki/Installation
%   - Simplest, RAVEN can be installed as MATLAB Add-On:
%     https://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html
%   - The installation of Gurobi as LP solver is highly recommended
checkInstallation; % Confirm that RAVEN is functional, should be 2.9.2 or later.

%   - Install GECKO by following the installation instructions:
%     https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/wiki/Installation-and-upgrade
%   - As RAVEN, GECKO can also be installed as MATLAB Add-On (link above)
%   - Add the appropriate GECKO (sub)folders to MATLAB path:
GECKOInstaller.install

%% STAGE 0: Preparation stage for ecModel reconstruction
% STEP 1 Preparation of project file structure and data
% - Initiate a basic structure of files and folders for your intended
%   project. This includes a copy of the template adapter.
%   The next line is commented out as the project structure is already
%   available in GECKO/tutorials/full_ecModel.
%startGECKOproject()

% STEP 2 Store the starting GEM
% - Find a high-quality GEM of your species of interest. ecYeastGEM is
%   based on yeast-GEM https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases
% - Release v8.6.2 of yeast-GEM is also distributed with GECKO at 
%   tutorials/full_ecModel/models/yeast-GEM.yml

% STEP 3-7 Modify the model adapter
% In the Nature Protocols paper is explained how to decide on the organism- and
% model-specific parameters in the model adapter, which for this tutorial is
% located at tutorials/full_ecModel/ecYeastGEMadapter.m.

%% STAGE 1: Expansion from a starting metabolic model to an ecModel structure
% STEP 8 Set modelAdapter
adapterLocation = fullfile(findGECKOroot,'tutorials','full_ecModel','YeastGEMAdapter.m');
ModelAdapter = ModelAdapterManager.setDefault(adapterLocation);

% With the above line, we set the YeastGEMAdapter as the default adapter
% from here onwards, which means that any GECKO function that requires a
% model adapter as input will use YeastGEMAdapter. This is until you have
% set a new default adapter, or closed MATLAB.

% We can also load the ModelAdapter into the MATLAB Workspace, so that you
% can quickly see its content, for instance the parameters.
ModelAdapter = ModelAdapterManager.getDefault();
params = ModelAdapter.getParameters();
% However, changes should not be made in this structure. Making a change in
% ModelAdapter in the Workspace has no effect (unless the ModelAdapter
% is explicitly provided as a function input), rather you should make the
% change in the adapter file and run again the command
% ModelAdapterManager.setDefault()

% STEP 9 Load conventional yeast-GEM
% If the location to the conventional GEM was already set in the modelAdapter,
% as obj.param.convGEM, then loadConventionalGEM can directly be used. If
% the model is stored somewhere else (and not specified in obj.param.convGEM),
% you can also use RAVEN's importModel(). In that case you will never use
% loadConventionalGEM and the obj.param.convGEM never has to be specified.
model = loadConventionalGEM();
% model = importModel(fullfile(geckoRoot,'tutorials','full_ecModel','models','yeast-GEM.yml'));

% STEP 10-11 Prepare ecModel
% We will make a full GECKO ecModel. For an example of reconstructing a 
% light GECKO ecModel, see tutorials/light_ecModel.
[ecModel, noUniprot] = makeEcModel(model,false);
% Note that noUniprot is empty: for all genes a match could be find in the
% Uniprot dataset.

% It can be helpful to read the function documentation: to read its
% function and what is the order of inputs and outputs.
doc makeEcModel

% STEP 12-13 Annotate with complex data
% As Saccharomyces cerevisiae is available on Complex Portal
% (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/), its data is included in
% ecYeastGEM.
% The next line is commented out, as the data is already available in the
% full_ecModel/data folder.
%complexInfo = getComplexData();
[ecModel, foundComplex, proposedComplex] = applyComplexData(ecModel);

% complexInfo can be given as second input, but not needed here, as it will
% read the file that was written by getComplexData.

% STEP 14 Store model in YAML format
% In this script there is code at the end of each stage to store a copy of
% the ecModel. However, only the stage 3 ecModel is kept and distributed
% together with GECKO (as is shown at the end of stage 3).
saveEcModel(ecModel,'ecYeastGEM_stage1.yml');

%% STAGE 2: integration of kcat into the ecModel structure
% Uncomment the line below if you want to reload the model.
%ecModel=loadEcModel('ecYeastGEM_stage1.yml'); 

% STEP 15 Different kcat sources
% Decide which kcat source to use. In the steps below, all options are
% shown. Not all are required, it is up to the user to decide which ones
% they want to use.

% STEP 16-17 Gather EC numbers, required for BRENDA as kcat source
% Requires EC numbers, which are here first taken from the starting model,
% with the missing ones taken from Uniprot & KEGG databases.
ecModel         = getECfromGEM(ecModel);
noEC = cellfun(@isempty, ecModel.ec.eccodes);
ecModel         = getECfromDatabase(ecModel,noEC);
% However, the EC numbers in the yeast-GEM model have not been thoroughly
% curated. Instead, we will take database-derived EC numbers for all
% reactions.
ecModel         = getECfromDatabase(ecModel);

% STEP 18-19 Gather kcat values from BRENDA
kcatList_fuzzy  = fuzzyKcatMatching(ecModel);
% Now we have a kcatList, which will be used to update ecModel in a later
% step.

% STEP 20-22 Gather metabolite SMILES, required for DLKcat as kcat source
% Metabolite SMILES are gathered from PubChem.
[ecModel, noSmiles] = findMetSmiles(ecModel);

% STEP 23 Prepare DLKcat input file
% An input file is written, which is then used by DLKcat, while the output
% file is read back into MATLAB.The full_ecModel tutorial already comes
% with a DLKcat.tsv file populated with kcat values. If this file should be
% regenerated, the line below should be uncommented. Note that this
% overwrites the existing files, thereby discarding existing kcat predictions.
%writeDLKcatInput(ecModel,[],[],[],[],true);

% STEP 24 Run DLKcat
% runDLKcat will run the DLKcat algorithm via a Docker image. If the
% DLKcat.tsv file already has kcat values, these will all be overwritten.
%runDLKcat();

% STEP 25 Load DLKcat output
kcatList_DLKcat = readDLKcatOutput(ecModel);

% STEP 26 Combine kcat from BRENDA and DLKcat
kcatList_merged = mergeDLKcatAndFuzzyKcats(kcatList_DLKcat, kcatList_fuzzy);

% STEP 27 Take kcatList and populate edModel.ec.kcat
ecModel  = selectKcatValue(ecModel, kcatList_merged);

% STEP 28 Apply custom kcat values
% During the development of yeast-GEM ecModels (through GECKO 1 & 2),
% various kcat values have been manually curated, to result in a model that
% is able to validate a wide range of phenotypes. These curations are
% summarized under /data/customKcats.tsv, and applied here.
[ecModel, rxnUpdated, notMatch] = applyCustomKcats(ecModel);

% To modify the S-matrix, to actually implement the kcat/MW constraints,
% applyKcatConstraints should be run. This is done in STEP 31.

% STEP 29 Get kcat values across isozymes
ecModel = getKcatAcrossIsozymes(ecModel);

% STEP 30 Get standard kcat
% Assign a protein cost to reactions without gene assocation. These
% reactions are identified as those without a corresponding entry in
% ecModel.grRules. The following reactions are exempted:
% A Exchange reactions: exchanging a metabolite across the model boundary,
%   not representing a real enzymatic reaction.
% B Transport reactions: transporting a metabolite with the same name from
%   one compartment to another. Real transport reactions should already be
%   annotated with grRules, so that the remaining non-annotated reactions
%   are mostly representing diffusion or pseudotransport processes such as
%   vesicles moving from ER to Golgi. While proteins are involved in such
%   processes, they are not catalyzed by enzymes.
% C Pseudoreactions: any other reaction that should not be considered to be
%   catalyzed by an enzyme. getStandardKcat recognizes these from the
%   reaction name contaning "pseudoreaction".
% D Custom list of non-enzyme reactions: if the above approaches does not
%   correctly identify all non-enzyme reactions that should be ignored by
%   getStandardKcat, /data/pseudoRxns.tsv can be specified in the adapter
%   folder, containing the relevant reaction identifiers.
[ecModel, rxnsMissingGPR, standardMW, standardKcat] = getStandardKcat(ecModel);

% STEP 31 Apply kcat constraints from ecModel.ec.kcat to ecModel.S
% While STEP 27-30 add or modify values in ecModel.ec.kcat, these contraints
% are not yet applied to the S-matrix: the enzyme is not yet set as pseudo-
% substrate with the -MW/kcat stoichiometry. Now, applyKcatConstraints will
% take the values from ecModel.ec.kcat, considers any complex/subunit data
% that is tracked in ecModel.ec.rxnEnzMat, together with the MW in
% ecModel.ec.mw, and uses this to modify the enzyme usage coefficients
% directly in ecModel.S. Any time a change is made to the .kcat, .rxnEnzMat
% or .mw fields, the applyKcatConstraints function should be run again to
% reapply the new constraints onto the metabolic model.
ecModel = applyKcatConstraints(ecModel);

% STEP 32 Set upper bound of protein pool
% The protein pool exchange is constrained by the total protein content
% (Ptot), multiplied by the f-factor (ratio of enzymes/proteins) and the
% sigma-factor (how saturated enzymes are on average: how close to their
% Vmax to they function based on e.g. metabolite concentrations). In 
% modelAdapter Ptot, f- and sigma-factors are specified (as rough
% estimates, 0.5 for each of the three parameters is reasonable).
Ptot  = params.Ptot;
f     = params.f;
sigma = params.sigma;

% However, these values can also be defined separately. The f-factor can be 
% calculated from quantitative proteomics data, for instance with data that
% is available via PAXdb (https://pax-db.org/).
f = calculateFfactor(ecModel); % Optional
ecModel = setProtPoolSize(ecModel,Ptot,f,sigma);

% Note that at a later stage (after stage 3), the sigma factor be further
% adjusted with sigmaFitter, to get a model that is able to reach a
% particular maximum growth rate. This will not be done here, as we first
% need to tune the kcat values in Stage 3.

saveEcModel(ecModel,'ecYeastGEM_stage2.yml');

%% STAGE 3: model tuning
% Uncomment the line below if you want to reload the model.
%ecModel=loadEcModel('ecYeastGEM_stage2.yml');

% STEP 33-38 Test maximum growth rate
% Test whether the model is able to reach maximum growth if glucose uptake
% is unlimited. First set glucose uptake unconstraint.
ecModel = setParam(ecModel,'lb','r_1714',-1000);
% And set growth maximization as the objective function.
ecModel = setParam(ecModel,'obj','r_4041',1);
% Run FBA.
sol = solveLP(ecModel,1);
bioRxnIdx = getIndexes(ecModel,params.bioRxn,'rxns');
fprintf('Growth rate: %f /hour.\n', sol.x(bioRxnIdx))
% The growth rate is far below 0.41 (the maximum growth rate of
% S. cerevisiae, that is entered in the model adapter as obj.params.gR_exp.

% STEP 39-42 Relax protein pool constraint
% As a simplistic way to ensure the model to reach the growth rate, the
% upper bound of the protein pool exchange reaction can be increased to
% whatever is required. This works, but STEP 43 is preferred.
ecModel = setParam(ecModel, 'lb', 'r_4041', 0.41);
ecModel = setParam(ecModel, 'lb', 'prot_pool_exchange', -1000);
ecModel = setParam(ecModel, 'obj', 'prot_pool_exchange', 1);
sol = solveLP(ecModel);

protPoolIdx = strcmp(ecModel.rxns, 'prot_pool_exchange');
fprintf('Protein pool usage is: %.0f mg/gDCW.\n', abs(sol.x(protPoolIdx)))
ecModel = setParam(ecModel,'lb',protPoolIdx,sol.x(protPoolIdx));

% Revert back growth constraint and objective function.
ecModel = setParam(ecModel,'lb','r_4041',0);
ecModel = setParam(ecModel,'obj','r_4041',1);

% STEP 43-44 Sensitivity tuning
% First reset the protein pool constraint to a more realistic value,
% reverting STEP 42.
ecModel = setProtPoolSize(ecModel);
[ecModel, tunedKcats] = sensitivityTuning(ecModel);

% Inspect the tunedKcats structure in table format.
struct2table(tunedKcats)

% STEP 45-51 Curate kcat values based on kcat tuning
% As example, the kcat of 5'-phosphoribosylformyl glycinamidine synthetase
% (reaction r_0079) was increased from 0.05 to 5. Inspecting the kcat
% source might help to determine if this is reasonable. 
rxnIdx = find(strcmp(kcatList_merged.rxns,'r_0079'));
doc fuzzyKcatMatching % To check the meaning of wildcardLvl and origin.
kcatList_merged.wildcardLvl(rxnIdx) % 0: no EC number wildcard.
kcatList_merged.origin(rxnIdx) % 4: any organism, any substrate, kcat.
kcatList_merged.eccodes(rxnIdx) % EC number 6.3.5.3.

% On BRENDA https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/enzyme.php?ecno=6.3.5.3#TURNOVER%20NUMBER%20[1/s]
% the kcat value is from E. coli with NH4+ as substrate. The reaction
% normally uses glutamine, so this kcat value might be misleading.
% Inspecting the abstract of the paper that is reporting this value
% https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2659070/ actually states "and NH3 can
% replace glutamine as a nitrogen donor with a Km = 1 M and a turnover of
% 3 min-1 (2% glutamine turnover)". The paper also reports a specific
% activity that can be used instead:
% https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/enzyme.php?ecno=6.3.5.3#SPECIFIC%20ACTIVITY%20[%C2%B5mol/min/mg]

% Convert specific activity of 2.15 umol/min/mg protein, where the protein
% has a molecular weight of 148905 Da, to kcat in /sec:

enzMW = ecModel.ec.mw(strcmp(ecModel.ec.enzymes,'P38972')); % Get MW of the enzyme.
convKcat = 2.15; % umol/min/mg protein, same as mmol/min/g protein.
convKcat = convKcat / 1000; % mol/min/g protein.
convKcat = convKcat / 60; % mol/sec/g protein.
convKcat = convKcat * enzMW % mol/sec/mol protein, same as 1/sec.

% New kcat is 5.3358, which is not far away from the tuned kcat of 5.

% This can be applied to the ecModel directly, or preferrably it should be
% included in the data/customKcat.tsv file.
ecModel = setKcatForReactions(ecModel,'r_0079',convKcat);
ecModel = applyKcatConstraints(ecModel);

saveEcModel(ecModel,'ecYeastGEM_stage3.yml');

% STEP 52 Save the curated ecModel without proteomics integration
% This functional ecModel will also be kept in the GECKO GitHub.
saveEcModel(ecModel,'ecYeastGEM.yml');

%% STAGE 4 integration of proteomics data into the ecModel.
% Uncomment the line below if you want to reload the model.
%ecModel=loadEcModel('ecYeastGEM_stage3.yml'); 

% STEP 53-57 Load proteomics data and constrain ecModel
protData = loadProtData(3); %Number of replicates, only one experiment.
ecModel = fillEnzConcs(ecModel,protData);
ecModel = constrainEnzConcs(ecModel);

% STEP 58 Update protein pool
%
% ==> Since GECKO 3.2.0:
%     All protein usage reactions draw from the protein pool, both for
%     proteins with and without concentration constraints. As a
%     consequence, updateProtPool has become obsolete. To set the protein
%     pool exchange with condition-specific total protein content, use
%     setProtPoolSize instead. For more explanation, see
%     https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO/issues/375
%
%     See STEP 32 for considerations about the f-factor. Here, we can
%     recalculate the f-factor based on the proteomics dataset.

f = calculateFfactor(ecModel,protData);
fluxData = loadFluxData();
ecModel = setProtPoolSize(ecModel,fluxData.Ptot(1),f);

% ==> Before GECKO 3.2.0:
%     The legacy code is still shown here, but should not be run.
        % The protein pool reaction will be constraint by the remaining, unmeasured
        % enzyme content. This is calculated by subtracting the sum of 
        % ecModel.ec.concs from the condition-specific total protein content. The
        % latter is stored together with the flux data that otherwise will be used
        % in STEP 59.
        % fluxData = loadFluxData();
        % ecModel = updateProtPool(ecModel,fluxData.Ptot(1));

% STEP 59-63 Load flux data
% Matching the proteomics sample(s), condition-specific flux data needs to
% be loaded to constrain the model. This was already loaded in STEP 58 for
% gathering Ptot, but is repeated here nonetheless. Flux data is read from
% /data/fluxData.tsv.
fluxData = loadFluxData();
% Use first condition.
ecModel = constrainFluxData(ecModel,fluxData,1,'max','loose');
% Observe if the intended growth rate was reached.
sol = solveLP(ecModel);
fprintf('Growth rate that is reached: %f /hour.\n', sol.f)
% The growth rate of 0.1 is far from being reached. Therefore, the next
% step is to flexibilize enzyme concentrations.

% STEP 64-65 Enzyme concentrations are flexibilized (increased), until the
% intended growth rate is reached. This is condition-specific, so the
% intended growth rate is gathered from the fluxData structure.
[ecModel, flexEnz] = flexibilizeEnzConcs(ecModel,fluxData.grRate(1),10);

% Neither individual enzyme levels nor total protein pool are limiting
% growth. Test whether the starting model is able to reach 0.1.
% If needed, uncomment the next line to reload the starting model
%model = loadConventionalGEM();
model = constrainFluxData(model,fluxData);
sol = solveLP(model)
fprintf('Growth rate that is reached: %f /hour.\n', sol.f)

% The starting model reaches a similar growth rate as the ecModel after
% flexibilizing enzyme concentrations. So the metabolic network would not
% be able to adhere to all measured constraints. Perhaps there is something
% incorrect with the measurements? Regardless, the ecModel is able to reach
% the same growth rate as the starting model, which will be fine for now.
sol = solveLP(ecModel)

% To inspect the flexibilized enzymes, we can look at the flexEnz
% structure. The enzymes are ordered by the ratio of increase, from high
% to low.

%% STAGE 5: simulation and analysis
% STEP 66 (Re)load the ecModel without proteomics integration.
ecModel = loadEcModel('ecYeastGEM.yml');

% STEP 67-68 Simulate Crabtree effect with protein pool
% We will below run a custom plotCrabtree function that is kept in the code

% where it is stored, but we will navigate back to the current folder
% afterwards.

% The plot will also be saved in the output subfolder.
saveas(gcf,fullfile(params.path,'output','crabtree.pdf'))

% The two graphs show (left:) exchange fluxes from simulations (lines) and

% (right:) the fraction of protein pool that is used by enzymes. In the
% left graph, the y-axis indicates absolute fluxes, so that glucose uptake
% and CO2 excretion both have positive numbers. The model simulation
% demonstrates the Crabtree-effect: at increasing growth rates yeast
% switches from respiration to fermentation, and this occurs when the
% protein pool becomes fully used and thereby limiting. The shift away from
% respiration is most clearly shown by reduced oxygen uptake and increased
% ethanol excretion.

% For comparison, make a similar Crabtree plot for a conventional GEM.
% Set protein pool to infinite, to mimic a conventional GEM.
