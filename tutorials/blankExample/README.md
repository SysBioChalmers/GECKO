## Folder overview

You can duplicate this yourModel folder (and give the new folder a name that is useful for you) for you own ecModel reconstruction and analysis work. The new folder does not necessarily have to be in the GECKO directory under 'tutorials/', but can be in any location of your choice.

The location of the new folder should be specified in the ModelAdapter.m file under 'obj.params.path'.

You should keep the overall folder structure ('code', 'data', 'models', 'output').

### `code` folder

Here you can keep custom codes for ecModel reconstruction and analysis.

### `data` folder

Here you can keep model-specific data for ecModel reconstruction and analysis.
GECKO will also save model-specific databases files in this location.

### `models` folder

Here GECKO will save the reconstructed and modified ecModels. You can also this location to store your own ecModel versions.

### `output` folder

Here you can keep model-specific output and resuts from ecModel reconstruction and analysis.
GECKO will also save model-specific output files in this location.
