% mapRxnsToConv
%   A vector (or matrix) of fluxes is mapped to the reactions in the
%   conventional starting model that was used to construct the ecModel. It
%   is essential that the provided conventional model is indeed the model
%   that was used to initate ecModel reconstruction.
%
% Input:
%   ecModel         an ecModel in GECKO 3 format (with ecModel.ec structure),
%                   that was used to obtain fluxVect
%   model           the starting model for ecModel, to which the reactions
%                   should be mapped
%   fluxVect        vector or matrix of flux values, matching ecModel.rxns
%
% Output:
%   mappedFlux      vector or matrix of flux values, matching model.rxns
%   enzUsageFlux    vector or matrix of flux values from enzyme usage
%                   reactions, as these are absent from mappedFlux
%   usageEnz        cell array with protein IDs, matching enzUsageFlux
%
% Usage:
%   [mappedFlux, enzUsageFlux, usageEnz] = mapRxnsToConv(ecModel, model, fluxVect)
