change_model/applyKcatConstraints.m	tc0011	
change_model/findMetSmiles.m	tc0012	
change_model/getComplexData.m	tc0003, tc0004 - File download not covered by test cases but is tested manually and works.	
change_model/makeEcModel.m	tc0001, tc0002	
change_model/setProtPoolSize.m	tc0005	
change_model/getKcatAcrossIsoenzymes.m	tc0011

gather_kcats/mergeDlkcatAndFuzzyKcats.m	tc0011	
gather_kcats/readDLKcatOutput.m	tcm0001, tcm0002 - The test doesn't really check the function, only that some output is read	
gather_kcats/runDLKcat.m	tcm0001, tcm0002 - The test doesn't really check the function, only that we get something
gather_kcats/selectKcatValue.m	tc0011 - we did not test all possible parameterizations here	
gather_kcats/writeDLKcatInput.m	partly by tc0011	
get_enzyme_data/calculateMW.m	Not explicitly tested - The code has existed for a long time	
get_enzyme_data/findECInDB.m	Called from getECfromDatabase - tested when that function is tested.	
get_enzyme_data/getECfromDatabase.m	tc0007 - does not test download of the databases - this is tested in the manual workflows for Yeast-GEM and Human-GEM	
get_enzyme_data/getECfromGEM.m	tc0006	
get_enzyme_data/getECstring.m	Called from findECInDB - tested when that function is tested.	
get_enzyme_data/loadBRENDAdata.m	Called from fuzzyKcatMatching - tested when that function is tested.	
get_enzyme_data/loadDatabases.m	Called from getECfromDatabase - tested when that function is tested.	
kcat_sensitivity_analysis/Bayesian/*	Has only been tested by running it manually, not tested by test cases

kcat_sensitivity_analysis/sigmaFitter.m	Not explicitly tested - The code has existed for a long time	
kcat_sensitivity_analysis/topUsedEnzymes.m	Not explicitly tested - The code has existed for a long time	Not sure this works anymore - written for the old model structure?
kcat_sensitivity_analysis/truncateValues.m	Not explicitly tested - The code has existed for a long time	
limit_proteins/constrainProtConcs.m	tc0013	
limit_proteins/findLimitingUBs.m	Not explicitly tested - The code has existed for a long time	Probably not relevant anymore, remove?

limit_proteins/getConcControlCoeffs.m	tc0013	
limit_proteins/updateProtPool.m		
model_adapter/ModelAdapter.m	Base class for adapters, not explicitly tested.	
model_adapter/ModelAdapterManager.m	tc0008	
utilities/*	Not explicitly tested - The code has existed for a long time. There are a lot of functions in here, unclear which of them are still useful and functional.
